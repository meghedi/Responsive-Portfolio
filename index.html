                    <p>Hello!</p>
                    <p>This is Meghedi, everybody calls me Meg, <br>
                        Its really hard to pronouce my name, except for Armenians. </p>

                    <p><strong>Fun fact about me: </strong><br>
                        I have been a developer for years but by taking this class I realized still there is so much to
                        learn
                        even in the simplest tasks that you thought you will be able to have it done in a second</p>

                    <p>and now that year is getting to an end, there is so much to recap for me, Its been an amazing,
                        fun and difficlut year
                        , I am hoping to acheive the best from this class and get to the goal I am reaching</p>

                    <p>One thing I am sure I am bad at, is writing and explainig myself, I usally prefer not to talk and
                        I am kind of a shy person I guess
                        , next class that I need to take is how to talk in public out loud, lol.
                    </p>

                    <p> That was all about me, not so fun person, but trying my best to enjoy life and be a happy person
                        for my baby and husband and myself :)</p>
